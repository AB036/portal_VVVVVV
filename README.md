This is my fork of VVVVVV. It adds portal mechanics using the mouse. Levels are changed.

How do I build this?
------------
The building process is exactly the same as in the original game. If you can build VVVVVV, you _should_ be able to build this version too.

On Linux, it might be:

  - Libraries required: libsdl2 and libsdl-mixer
    - Use the ones with the headers, on Debian it's `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev`
    - Warning: you need libsdl2 >= 2.0.5. If your package manager can't give you that, I think the easiest is to compile libsdl2 and libsdl2-mixer yourself. Make sure that ogg and wav support is enabled.
  - Go to `desktop_version` and use Cmake:

```bash
cd desktop_version
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

  - You need to place `data.zip` in the same directory as the `VVVVVV` executable. You might get it here: [Make and Play](https://thelettervsixtim.es/makeandplay/)
